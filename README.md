This repository provides an efficient **CUDA/C++ extension** of the Hungarian Algorithm, seamlessly integrated with PyTorch and optimized for batched 300 √ó N (N ‚â§ 300) assignment problems‚Äîcommonly encountered in the training of **DETR** and related models.

Compared to the widely-used SciPy's CPU-based `linear_sum_assignment`, this implementation delivers a **8~160√ó speed-up** on random inputs and a **3~10√ó speed-up** in practical DETR training scenarios, evaluated on **NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs**.

## üöÄ Features

- Supports batched assignment problems of shape [B √ó 300 √ó N]
  - The maximum size of each cost matrix can be adjusted by updating `MAX_ROWS` and `MAX_COLS` in the CUDA source code before compiling
  - Each cost matrix can have a different size; pad to size N with INF values before stacking (N ‚â§ 300)
  - Uses `torch.float32` as the data type for cost matrices

- GPU parallelization of the Hungarian Algorithm includes:
  - Initialization of dual variables
  - Œî-minimum search with warp-level reduction
  - Potentials update (u, v, minv)
  - Final assignment and write-out

- Fully validated against SciPy's `linear_sum_assignment` in terms of:
  - Correctness
  - Runtime performance

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch ‚â• 2.0 (with `torch.utils.cpp_extension`)
- NVIDIA driver ‚â• 535
- CUDA ‚â• 12.2 (earlier versions may work)
- C++17-compatible compiler and NVCC
  
> Tested on: NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

**1. Run the demo script**

```bash
python hungarian_gpu_batch.py
```

This will:
- Compile the CUDA/C++ extension inline
- Run tests using random cost matrices
- Compare GPU results with SciPy CPU results
- Report runtime speed-up statistics

You will see per-trial performance logs followed by average statistics across the last 10 runs. Example output:
```log
Mean valid ncols in cost matrix: 203.75
GPU runtime      :    3.85 ms
SciPy CPU runtime:   32.69 ms
Speed-up         :    8.50 x

Mean valid ncols in cost matrix: 164.62
GPU runtime      :    3.23 ms
SciPy CPU runtime:   29.52 ms
Speed-up         :    9.13 x

...
...

Average of the last 10 Loops
GPU runtime      :    1.49 ms
SciPy CPU runtime:   24.67 ms
Speed-up         :   20.67 x
```

**2. Use in your own code**

A simple example:

```python
import torch
from hungarian_gpu_batch import hungarian_gpu

cost = torch.rand((16, 300, 300), device="cuda", dtype=torch.float32)  # Batched cost matrices
Ns = torch.randint(1, 301, (16,), device="cuda", dtype=torch.int32)    # Batched actual task numbers, each Ni corresponds to one cost matrix (entries beyond Ni are ignored)

output = hungarian_gpu(cost, Ns)
```

## üìä Performance

**1. Random Testing**

We present a speed-up curve with respect to varying batch sizes (B), using randomly padded input cost matrices of shape [B √ó 300 √ó 300]. Experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

**2. Real-World Application**

We integrate this GPU-based Hungarian Algorithm into the DETR training pipeline by replacing SciPy's `linear_sum_assignment`.

With a per-GPU batch size of 16 (each GPU processing its own local samples), this implementation achieves a **3√ó speed-up**, leading to an overall **10%** reduction in training overhead. As batch size increases, the speed-up would become even more pronounced, consistent with the trends observed in random testing.
